New Year's Resolution Generator
===============================

**[New Year's Resolution Generator][website]** is inspired by [Google][] — where I stole the categories — and [another generator][another].

Why does this look so ugly?
---------------------------

Because I intentionally do not do any styling. I want to see what this project would look like after a month, or next year. I only finished the fundamental functions which are basically what this project needs.

There are some things I think you can help improve how this project looks:

* Layout
* Fonts
* Colors
* Icons
* Code
* README
* Everything!

Feel free to change anything.
